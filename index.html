    <p>Here is some info about my work background:</p>
    <p>From 2012 untill 2020 I was the owner of Disposal Dent. A medical wholesale company where I sold nitrile gloves and mouth masks to dental practices and pedicures. Disposal Dent haves more than 100 dental practices as regular customers. I was fully responsible for purchasing, sales, administration and all other activities that belong to my own company. In the past 7 years I have grown enormously. I was introduced to stress, perseverance, risks, time management, all matters in which I developed myself enormously. I like to see my next step outside of my own company, because I would like invest more in myself by learning how to code. Thats why I sold my company.</p>
